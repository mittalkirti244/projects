- `messages_<locale>.properties` files looked for in all i18n folders (not just the first)
- Structured types as key
- Support for localization in custom handlers
- `InsertResult` (beta):
  - iterator that returns the keys of the created entries, for example:
    - Example: `[...result]` -> `[{ ID: 1 }, { ID: 2 }, ...]`
    - in case of `INSERT...as(SELECT...)`, the iterator returns `{}` for each row
  - `affectedRows`: the number inserted (root) entries or the number of affectedRows in case of INSERT into SELECT
  - `valueOf()`: returns `affectedRows` such that comparisons like `result > 0` can be used
    - Note: `===` can't be used as it also compares the type
- Authentication strategy `xsuaa` (only with `@sap/xssec^3`) that additionally provides access to saml attributes via `req.user.attr` (for example, `req.user.attr.familyName`)

### Changed

- SQL queries don't use placeholders for rows of LIMIT clause

- Additional properties in payload are preserved for entities with `@cds.persistence.skip` when served to `rest`
- RemoteService: Ignore where clause of view definition during INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE instead of throwing error
- Don't use SQL placeholders for numbers
- Service-level `@requires` are checked in protocol adapter instead of ApplicationService (excluding metadata requests)

- `@restrict` with association paths and `$user.<attr>` in where
- Result of deep insert
- `UPDATE` statements in custom handlers on Application Service setting only falsy values or using only expressions like `{stock: {'-=': 1}}`

### Changed

- Streamlined `req.reject/error/info(code, msg, target, args)`: takes four individual params (number, string, string, array) or one object
- Changed behavior by handler registration:
  -- Handlers registered with entity = `*` aren't called by unbound events anymore.
  -- Handlers registered without entity aren't called by bound events anymore.
  -- Special case: Handlers registered in form .before/on/after(\'\*\', handler) are called by bound and unbound events.
- Expanding association from draft-enabled entity to draft enabled entities always provides active version of the expanded entity.
- If you export a function in an `init.js` file, it will be called with the primary database, and its result is awaited.
- REST: Since the service is now based on the `cds.Service` base class, all convenience functions (`create`, `post`, etc.) are streamlined.
- Messaging: Only one queue per app is created, as opposed to one queue per app and external service.
- Messaging: You can now directly connect to the (technical) messaging service through `await cds.connect.to('messaging')`, no topic names are generated here.
- Messaging: If you want to link your own or external services to messaging, you need to model your events in CDS.
- Messaging: If you want to provide custom topics for modeled events, you need to add the `@topic` annotation to the event.
- Messaging: The `prefix` option in the service's credentials is prepended to events with a `@topic` annotation.
- Messaging: The syntax to emit events with headers changed:
  ```js
  srv.emit({ event: 'yourEvent', data: { some: 'data' }, headers: { some: 'headers' } })
  ```
- Messaging: The default file for `file-based-messaging` is `~/.cds-msg-box`.
- Streamlined handler registration: `srv.before/on/after(<event>, <entity>?, <handler>)`
  - Event and handler are mandatory; entity must be omitted if unbound action/function (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE are considered to be bound)
  - Event and entity may be arrayed
  - `srv.before/on/after(*, <handler>)` matches all as shorthand
- `INSERT` statements return an object or array of objects (in case of bulk) with the number of affected rows as result of `valueOf()`, as well as the keys of the inserted entities:
  ```js
  const res = await srv.run(
    INSERT.into('Books').entries([
      { ID: 1, title: 'one' },
      { ID: 2, title: 'two' }
    ])
  )
  res > 1 // > true
  res.keys // > [{ ID: 1 }, { ID: 2 }]
  ```

### Removed

## Version 2.0.3 - 2020-06-19

### Added

- Custom translatable error messages
- Support for containment in CRUD
- Support for static values in custom on conditions for associations

### Changed

- on() function for joins doesn't support the simple conditions like on(x, =, y) anymore. Only fluent expressions and object predicates are supported.

### Fixed

- Enterprise Messaging: Received messages are correctly decoded
- Reading single properties of draft enabled entities via navigations e. g. `/E0(ID=<uuid>,IsActiveEntity=false)/e1(ID=<uuid>,IsActiveEntity=false)/property`
- Not supported transformation in `groupby` throws cryptic error
- etag check only if OData request
- Statements if path expression contains keys of type `cds.Timestamp`, `cds.DateTime` or `cds.Time`
- `$filter` lambda `any` operator if no argument is provided
- User attributes in `req.user.attr` merge `info.userInfo` and `info.userAttributes` (authentication strategy `JWT`)
- User authentication challenges

### Removed

- Support for nested user attributes in `@restrict.where`, e.g., `$user.name.familyName`

## Version 2.0.2 - 2020-06-10

### Added

- Support for XSUAA's user attribute value `$UNRESTRICTED`
- Default to combination `[...];IEEE754Compatible=true;ExponentialDecimals=true` if IEEE754Compatible or ExponentialDecimals is omitted
- Use custom authenticate middleware via `cds.env.requires.auth.impl`
- Authentication strategy `dummy` (`cds.env.requires.auth.strategy = 'dummy'`) that creates super users (i.e., pass all authorization checks)
- Support relative destination path in rest-client

### Changed

- CQN returned for `req.query` changed â€” for requests with path expressions, the returned CQN of `req.query` is changed to a simplified format. For `GET /Authors(150)/books` the CQN contains the path in `.from` instead of an `exists` clause in `.where`.

```
{ SELECT:  {  from: { "ref": [
        {
          "id": "AdminService.Authors",
          "where": [ { "val": 150 } ]
        },
      "books"
      ] } } }
```

- Authorizations as whitelist: if any restrictions exist for the target, all not explicitly allowed operations are forbidden (e.g., `@restrict: [{ grant: 'READ', ... }]` -> everything but `READ` is forbidden for all, including bound actions and functions)
- Applicable `@requires` and `@restrict` definitions concatenated by AND
- Reference to undefined XSUAA user attribute in `@restrict.where` results in forbidden
- `req.event` for unbound actions and functions is provided without service prefix
- Increased logging in production (temporarily until revised logging concept is implemented)
- `cds.serve(..., { passport: [...] }` -> `cds.serve(..., { auth: [...] }`

### Fixed

- `INSERT.into.as(SELECT.from...)` with `SELECT` containing placeholders
- Requests on a navigation to many with key provided returns 404 if the resource doesn't exist
- POST/PATCH requests on `Composition of many` with backlink association as key
- Path expressions on SAP HANA are now flat and not structured anymore
- `$expand` on `Composition of many` with backlink association as key
- Roles from scopes including "."
- Ignore unknown arrayed column during input validation
- Too early client release
- Pool configurations with default values can be set to `0`

- Annotations `@cds.onInsert` and `@cds.onUpdate` ignore values from the request
- Processing of read-only values moved to initial before handler

### Added

- Support for `orderBy` in rest-client

### Changed

- `limit` in CQN is translated to placeholders in SQL
- QL API: .where() is changed:
  -- Where with two parameters like .where('x', 1) isn't allowed and should be replaced with .where('x', '=', 1).
  -- Combinations with partial CQNs like .where({ref: ['x']}, '=', 1) aren't allowed. Use arrays of partial CQNs like .where([ {ref: ['x']}, '=', {val: 1} ]) instead.
  -- Fluent expressions work as strictly alternating string/value lists (as documented). Partial CQN can be used here as value.
- Per default, results are now ordered by keys of the entity

- `context.diff()` ignores `@cds.persistence.skip` annotated entities
- Always try to read from localized views (also by draft enabled entities)
- In multitenant scenario, the CSN model is now always loaded from `@sap/cds-mtx`. Previously, it was only loaded if it was extended.
- Use open source version of `@sap-cloud-sdk/core`
- If a column or column alias is used multiple times in a SELECT query, the query is from now on rejected. Example: `SELECT.from(Foo).columns(['c1', 'c1'])`
